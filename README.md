## Abstract
 This document provide security for the data that contains alphabets, numerals and special characters during its transmission. However because of the drawbacks inherent in the classical Playfair cipher which adversely affects the security, this method proposed 3D-Playfair Cipher (4 X 4 X 4 Playfair cipher) which works on trigraph rather than using digraph and it eliminates the fact that a diagram and its reverse will encrypt in a similar fashion. 3D-Playfair cipher supports all 26 alphabets,10 digits and 28 special characters eliminating the limitation of classical Playfair in which “i” and “j”, both character cannot appear at the same time. 3D-Playfair enhances the security by increasing complexity. Various types of cryptography attacks have been taken under consideration for original Playfair cipher but not vulnerable for this proposed cipher.
